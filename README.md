# myprojects
Thank you for visiting my page. You can find and check my projects here. 
My first project is an intermediate project on Karpov course of Data Analyst. My task you can find in doc "Task" and project in "i-levin_project_variant1.ipynb". Task and comments are in english language.
My second project is a 'pet' project for MOLOT HARDCORP - a young Russian comics publisher. MOLOT HARDCORP has a website where is selling their own products B2C. 
There is a small and simple CRM that gather some neccessary info for delivery. The output from the CRM is a csv.file. I decided to work with this file, process it and try to find some insights.
